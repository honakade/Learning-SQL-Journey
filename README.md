# Learning SQL Journey 📊

Welcome to my **SQL Learning Journey**! This repository documents my progress, projects, and exercises as I learn and practice SQL. My goal is to build a solid foundation in SQL and develop skills to analyze data effectively, design databases, and create meaningful insights.

---

## 🚀 **Learning Goals**
Here are the main objectives I aim to achieve through this journey:
- Understand SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.).
- Learn how to use JOINS, subqueries, and window functions.
- Normalise and design relational databases.
- Work on real-world projects using SQL to query datasets.
- Visualise data insights using tools like Excel, Tableau, or Power BI.
- Prepare for advanced use cases such as performance optimization and complex queries.

## 📝 **Progress Updates**
### **Current Status**
- 🔥 **Topics Completed**:
  - SELECT statements
  - WHERE conditions and filtering
  - JOINs and subqueries
  - Aggregation and GROUP BY
- 🛠️ **In Progress**: Designing relational databases and working on mini-projects.

### **Recent Updates**
- Added practice queries for `JOINS` and `GROUP BY`.
- Completed first project: **Bike Buyer Analysis** (check the [Projects](Projects/) folder).
- Studied SQL performance tuning basics.

## 💻 **Projects**
Here are some projects I’ve worked on:
1. [**Bike Buyer Analysis**](Projects/Bike_Buyer_Analysis/): Cleaned and analysed a dataset to identify key factors influencing bike purchases.
2. **[E-commerce Sales Analysis]** (Coming Soon): Querying and analysing sales data to find trends and optimise strategies.

Visit the [Projects](Projects/) folder for detailed descriptions and SQL scripts.

## 📚 **Resources**
Here are some resources I’ve found helpful while learning SQL:
- [SQL Tutorial on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
- [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorials](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)
- [LeetCode Database Questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for practice projects.

## 🧠 **What I’ve Learned**
Here’s a summary of some key takeaways:
- The power of `JOINs` to combine multiple tables and enrich data analysis.
- The importance of understanding normalisation to design efficient databases.
- Using window functions for advanced analytics (e.g., ranking and cumulative totals).

Check the [Notes](Notes/) folder for detailed write-ups on these topics.

## 🌟 **Next Steps**
- Work on more complex datasets to strengthen query writing skills.
- Learn about advanced SQL topics like window functions and stored procedures.
- Explore performance optimisation techniques in SQL.
- Integrate SQL with visualisation tools like Tableau or Power BI.
